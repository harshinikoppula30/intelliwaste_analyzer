# intelliwaste_analyzer
Deep learning-based garbage classification project using VGG16 on Kaggle dataset. Includes Colab notebook, dataset link, and model training process for waste segregation. The rapid growth of global waste generation presents significant challenges to environmental sustainability and public health. Manual waste segregation is inefficient, labor-intensive, and potentially hazardous. To address this, we propose IntelliWaste Analyzer—an intelligent, automated waste classification system powered by deep learning and image recognition. Our solution utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced by transfer learning using the VGG16 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet. The model is fine-tuned with a custom classification head to suit our waste dataset and classifies images into six categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. Input images are resized to 224×224 pixels and normalized to optimize performance without needing to train a CNN from scratch. Developed using TensorFlow and Keras, the system is lightweight, accurate, and scalable for real-time deployment in smart waste bins, recycling plants, and municipal waste management systems. In future iterations, we plan to expand classification to 12 detailed waste categories (e.g., battery, biological, clothing, colored glass) using a more diverse dataset, making the system even more adaptable to real-world waste management challenges.
